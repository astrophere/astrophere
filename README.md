## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Mel â€” a passionate programmer and physicist.
I program a little bit in everything, with my main language being C++. I work across a broad range of technologies, with experience in Python, PowerShell, Hyper-V, batch scripting, MATLAB, Simulink, Mathematica, and custom languages built with ANTLR.
I have tons of ideas and problems, which I enjoy tackling with creative, hands-on solutions. I love the freedom to experiment, build and learn through trial and error.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Unreal Engine & Unreal Engine for Fortnite.
